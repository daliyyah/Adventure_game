# Adventure_game
A Python interactive simple story game


# How to Design the game:
The idea is to focus on some key things to make a working game:

* The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
* Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
* The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
* The game has conditions for winning and losing.
* When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.


# Instructions:
1- Print descriptions of what's happening for the player from the code
2- Pausing between printing descriptions
3- Give the player some choices
4- Make sure the player gives a valid input
5- Add functions and refactor your code
6- Use randomness in the game
7- Create win and lose conditions
8- Check if the player wants to play again
